latexdraw
=========

A vector drawing editor for LaTeX.

Documentation and installation requirements (in particular regarding LaTeX):
https://github.com/arnobl/latexdraw/wiki/Manual

Binaries and installation files to download on Sourceforge:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/latexdraw/

**How to run**

You downloaded the binaries of a 4.x version and you want to run the app.
Go in the `bin` folder and launch the `latexdraw-run` file (or `latexdraw-run.bat` on Windows).


**On Windows**, the system may tell you `Windows has protected your computer`.
To overcome this issue, right-click on this file, click on the `properties` menu, and activate the `unlock` checkbox.

**On MacOSX**, you may have the message `damaged and can't be opened. You should eject the disk image"` after installing the app.
Look here: https://secure.clcbio.com/helpspot/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=323 and here:
https://osxdaily.com/2019/02/13/fix-app-damaged-cant-be-opened-trash-error-mac/

You do not need Java for running the app.
For rendering LaTeX instructions, you need an up-to-date LaTeX installation.

**How to report a bug**

Before reporting a bug, please check the following elements:
- Make sure you use the **latest LaTeXDraw version**.

- Make sure your LaTeX installation is up to date (in particular for export / compilation issues). In particular with MikTeX, [run the update utilities](https://miktex.org/howto/update-miktex) to check that. We already faced errors solved by updating MikTeX.

- **Do you have LaTeX and some required packages installed?** The required packages are: `pstricks`, `pstricks-add`, `pst-grad`, `pst-plot`, `geometry`, `pst-tools`.
To render text thumbnails the app use either GhostScript (`gs`) or `pdftoppm` (provided by `poppler-utils` and Texlive on Linux ).

- **With MikTeX, check the auto-install of missing packages is enable.** MikTeX can install on-demand (during the compilation of a document) the missing packages. Go in the MikTeX preferences to check that this feature is enable (either 'yes' or 'ask me first'), as depicted by the following screenshot:

![miktext config](http://latexdraw.sourceforge.net/images2/miktex.png)

- **Did you look at "the current issues"** section and the reported issues (https://github.com/latexdraw/latexdraw/issues)?

- **Does the problem still occur using the latest development version?** (See the links in the next section).

**If you still have a problem**, please do the following steps while reporting the bug:
- **Copy/paste in a bug report or on the forum** the information provided in the "system" tab you can find here: "Help" menu -> "About LateXDraw" menu item -> "system" tab.

- **Provide either a scenario** that I can execute to reproduce the problem, or an SVG document plus some instructions regarding the problem.
- **Be nice**. You did not pay for the software and I develop it on my free time since more than one decade.
- **Report your bug** on Github (https://github.com/latexdraw/latexdraw/issues).


**Latest development version**

You can test the next 4.x development version using the following binaries and installation files:
- for Linux (Fedora): https://ci.inria.fr/malai/job/latexdraw4/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/
- for Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): https://ci.inria.fr/malai/job/latexdraw4deb/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/
- for Windows: https://ci.inria.fr/malai/job/latexdraw4win/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/
- MacOsX: https://ci.inria.fr/malai/job/latexdraw4mac/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/


**Linux packaging** 

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/latexdraw.svg)](https://repology.org/metapackage/latexdraw)


**Build LaTeXDraw**

To compile you need JDK14 and Maven:
https://adoptopenjdk.net

The default Maven profile is for Linux and does not work for Windows and MacOSX
If you want to compile the project on MacOSX use the `mac` profile.
On Windows, use the `win` profile.
To do so, you have to add the option `-P mac` or `-P win` in the following Maven commands.

If you just want to compile the app:
`mvn clean compile`

If you want to build the app (and produce platform-specific installer files):
`mvn clean package`

If you run the tests, you need LaTeX to be installed (and PSTricks packages). 
If you want to skip the tests:
`mvn -DskipTests=true clean package`

If you want to skip the tests and the linters:
`mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dcheckstyle.skip -Dspotbugs.skip`

The packaging step is specific for each OS (Fedora, Debian, Windows, MacOSX, etc.):
it uses tools these OS' provide to build installation files.
These tools are:
- On Fedora, you need `rpmbuild`:
 `dnf install rpm-build`
- On Debian/Ubuntu, you need `fakeroot`: `apt install fakeroot`
- On Windows, you need `WIX toolset` (https://wixtoolset.org)
- On MacOSX, it seems to work without any supplementary installation

If you do not want to go through this step, you can ask Maven to ignore these steps:
`mvn clean package -Dexec.skip -Dassembly.skipAssembly`



**LaTeXDraw 3.x serie**

We do not maintain the 3.x serie anymore.
